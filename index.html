      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      
      <p>Macauley and Timothy had been searching for the right rescue dog for months. On the morning of January 28th, they woke up a little worse for the wear after their house warming party the night before. While lying in bed (still feeling fragile) at 5pm that night, Macauley received an email that would change their puppy-free life from that point forward! When they saw Parsley (then called Jenny) in the email, they instantly knew that she was meant for them. After a week of paperwork and a home check, they were due to pick up Parsley on February 25th, 2018. She would fly from Cyprus on a freedom flight with 12 other rescue dogs, arrive in Paris, and then be couriered to a pick up point close to London. At just 7 months old, Macauley and Timothy picked her up at a Noodle Shop in Essex at about 10pm that Sunday night, and could not believe how tiny she was. It was love at first sight. <br>
      <br>
        Parsley’s original name was Jenny, so Macauley and Timothy decided to call her Parsley Jenny, or PJ for short. PJ fit into their home perfectly, and this little family of three was set to begin their adventures! Parsley’s cuddled up in London most the time, but has been all over London, down to the coast, and up to Scotland. Follow along to see where she goes next! Although the family enjoys their adventures, Parsley loves duvet days with her mom and dad more than anything… except maybe chicken… drizzled with olive oil. </p>
