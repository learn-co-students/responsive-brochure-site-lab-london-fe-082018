      <p> In this practice website, I will give advice about travelling in Bali.</p>
      
      <p> Bali is very cultural, there are a lot of temples you must visit. This particular temple called Pura Tirta temple. </p>
      
      <div id=quote>Tirta Empul is an important temple complex and holy mountain spring, located in the village of Manukaya in central Bali. The site serves as a legendary setting of a traditional tale about good versus evil. It is also a national cultural heritage site. 
       The complex, built circa 960 AD, is also a silent witness to the old Balinese kingdom years, particularly at the time of the Warmadewa Dynasty. Another nearby and prominent site on top of a hill is the presidential palace, Istana Tampaksiring, built during the years of the nation’s first president, Soekarno.
      Tirta Empul, meaning ‘holy water spring’ is actually the name of a water source located within the temple. The spring feeds various purification baths, pools and fish ponds surrounding the outer perimeter, which all flow to the Tukad Pakerisan River. Various sites throughout the region and many other archaeological relics relate to local myths and legends.

      <p> Activities you can do by the beach includes horse riding in the sunset </p>

      <p> Be warned that there appears to be more pools than there are people. The hardest decision you will have to make everyday is whether you lounge by the pool or by the beach that day. Or if bored, you can always make your way by the cliffside and admire the view from atop. </p>
